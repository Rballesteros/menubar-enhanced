# chore(deps): update Electron to 39.x.x and adjust peer dependencies

Commit: `de556055c494c2853a0c6329fc5ff931ba94ae8d`

## Summary

- Updated the Electron dependency to the `39.x.x` release line and adjusted related peer dependency declarations.
- Minor documentation update to reflect the change.

## What changed

- `package.json`: Bumped Electron version and adjusted `peerDependencies` / `devDependencies` as required.
- `yarn.lock`: Locked the updated dependency tree for Electron `39.x.x`.
- `README.md`: Updated documentation references to the supported Electron version.

## Why

- To stay on a supported Electron release, pick up security fixes, platform improvements, and ensure compatibility with downstream apps that depend on a modern Electron runtime.

## Migration / Upgrade notes

- Projects using this library should ensure their Electron runtime is compatible with `39.x.x`. If your application targets an older Electron line, test the integration before upgrading.
- If your project uses native modules or binary dependencies, rebuild them for Electron 39 (for example, run a full reinstall and rebuild):

```bash
rm -rf node_modules && yarn install && yarn rebuild
```

- Check peer dependency warnings during install and update consuming projects accordingly.

## Testing

- Run the test suite: `yarn test` and ensure no regressions.
- Run the example apps in `examples/` to verify runtime behavior against Electron 39:
  - Example: `cd examples/hello-world && yarn install && yarn start` (adjust commands per example's package scripts).
- Verify packaging / menubar behavior on target platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux) if applicable.

## Compatibility & Risk

- Moderate risk: runtime behavior differences across Electron major versions may affect native integrations or APIs that have changed.
- No API surface changes to this library are expected; this is a dependency bump and doc update. Consumers should still validate behavior in their environments.

## Release notes

- Dependency update: Electron -> `39.x.x`.
- Documentation updated to reflect new supported Electron version.

If you want, I can also add a short changelog entry under `CHANGELOG.md` or open a PR with this as the description.
